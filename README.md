# HandSnake Project

Using OpenCV to make the snake game playable by a funnier way: with your own hand!. 
The snake game wasn't developed by me, I just made the integration between the game and the Python library.
To run, just install OpenCV and PyGame libraries, and:

```
python3 snake.py
```

You must use a white background (or one with a Solid Color) in order to the game work!
